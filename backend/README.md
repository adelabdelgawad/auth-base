Absolutely! Here is a **professional, clear, and concise `README.md`** for your FastAPI+SQLModel project, with uv, async, and modern Python best practices.

# Mabara Voucher API

A modern, async, production-ready FastAPI application for managing branches, units, vouchers, accounts, and more.  
Built with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), [SQLModel](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/), and [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast dependency management and lightning-fast development.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Async CRUD** for all resources
- **SQLModel** for type-safe, modern data modeling
- **uv** for ultra-fast, reliable dependency management
- **Modular routers** for each resource
- **Robust logging** and error handling
- **Ready for production or local development**

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended for dependency management)
- SQLite (default) or your preferred async-compatible database

---

## ⚡️ Quickstart

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mabara-voucher.git
cd mabara-voucher
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
# or, for a fresh install:
uv pip install "fastapi[standard]" sqlmodel aiosqlite
```

### 3. Run database migrations (if any)

If you use Alembic or similar, run migrations.  
For a fresh SQLite DB, tables will be auto-created on first run.

### 4. Start the development server

```bash
uv run fastapi dev
```
or
```bash
uv run uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## 🛠️ API Endpoints

Each resource (branch, unit, account, etc.) has full async CRUD endpoints:

- `GET /resource/` - List all
- `GET /resource/{id}` - Get by ID
- `POST /resource/` - Create
- `PUT /resource/{id}` - Update
- `DELETE /resource/{id}` - Delete

Interactive docs available at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).

---

## 🧑‍💻 Development

- All routers are in separate files for clarity and maintainability.
- Use `SessionDep` from `core.dependencies` for async database access.
- Logging is enabled for all endpoints.
- Error handling is robust and concise.
